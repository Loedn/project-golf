Butchart has retained many of its original features. The course layout was fundamentally changed when in 1928 the Metropolitan Water Board built the Bishopswood Reservoir around the area that is now the 10th and 13th holes. This reservoir currently stores 40 million litres of water to supply North London with drinking water. The course currently measures 6,015 yards with a par and standard scratch of 69 with the ladies at just over 5,400 yards with par 72 standard scratch 72. To demonstrate the test of golf Highgate offers those who play it, the current amateur course record of 66 was first scored in 1984 and whilst equalled on a number of occasions still remains the toughest record to beat.", price: 80, owner: user)

Finchley', address: 'Nether Court, Frith Ln, London NW7 1PU', description: "The 18 hole course is laid out in mature parkland. The holes are lined with a variety of trees which bring colour, definition and visual impact to the course. The clubhouse was once home to a Victorian industrialist, Henry Tubbs, with strong business links to Canada. The trees, bushes and shrubs on the course close to the clubhouse near the 1st, 12th, and 18th greens reflect that connection and are all indigenous to North America. The variety of trees close to the fountain on the 12th hole, in particular, have been brought together for deliberate visual appeal. The course is home to a range of urban wildlife including Muntjac deer, foxes and squirrels. The course itself plays fairly tight overall. There are slopes on many of the fairways and on the greens. To play the course well therefore requires a player to find relatively small landing areas. The greens are renowned locally for their pace, trueness and generally excellent condition.", price: 45, owner: user)
